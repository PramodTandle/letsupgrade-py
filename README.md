Assignment 2 
1.Definition and rules to define variables:
 A variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Typically, a program consists of instructions that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running. 
•	A variable is assigned to data by assignment operator.
•	A variable cannot start with a number.
•	Python is case sensitive and hence variables also case sensitive.
•	A variables can contain letters (upper case or lower case), numbers and underscores.
•	A keyword cannot be used as variable. ”if”, “def “ and “for” are the reserved keywords. They cannot be used as variables.
2.What does mean backslash?
The backslash (\) is a typographic and/or keyboard mark that is used in some programming languages and other  computing context. Outside quoted string, the only common use of backslash is to ignore (“escape”) a newline immediately after it. In this context it may be called a “continuation” as the current line continues into the next one. 
3.Tiple quotation :
 It is a nice way to be able to include other types of  quotation within your string without having to use escape characters.
For example : print(“He said\” my name’s John\’’’) That example requires escape characters \” touse double quote marks.
4.Formatted output: 
 Formatted output, it converts the internal binary representation of the data to ASCII characters which are written to the output file. Formatted input reads characters from the input file and converts them to internal form. 
5. Assignment operator:
 Assignment operator are used in python to assign values to variables . a=5 is a simple assignment operator that assigns the value 5 on the right to the variable a on the left. There are various compound operators in python like a+=5 that adds to the variable and later assigns the same.
